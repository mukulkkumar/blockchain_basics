## BlockChain

Blockchain is a data structure that chains all the mined blocks in a chronological order. This chain is immutable and thus temper-proof.

Suppose, we have some BitCoins and for those BitCoins, we have transactions.

```
t1 = "A sends 2 BC (BitCoin) to B"
t2 = "C sends 2 BC (BitCoin) to D"
t3 = "E sends 2 BC (BitCoin) to F"
```
```
B1 ("AAA", t1, t2, t3) -> 87fd46, B2 ("87fd46", t1, t2, t3) -> 4564uy, B3 ("4564uy", t1, t2, t3) -> 54ds89
```
